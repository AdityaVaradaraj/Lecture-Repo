# Assignment 1 

## Details

* For the 1st assignment, you'll be implementing Linear Regression in numpy, on this dataset. We suggest you do this in a Jupyter Notebook. 
* Load the data, with pandas, visualise with matplotlib and then implement the Linear Regression Model using numpy.
* The implementation should be vectorized, which can work on any number of features, though the given dataset has just one feature for simplicity. The objective is to predict y given x1.

## Submission Format

* The Jupyter Notebook should be titled **<your-github-username>.ipynb**. For example my submission would be **salman-bhai.ipynb**.
* The submission must strictly be inside the file path **/Lecture-Repo/Winter_Mentorship_2017/Machine_Learning/Group_3/Submissions** and any submission not following this would be rejcted.

## Submission Method

* You have to fork this repository and after you have uploaded the Python Notebook on your forked repository, then send a Pull Request to the Web Club Repository.
* In case you have any doubts regarding the same, please feel free to contact any of the Web Club mentors regarding this!
